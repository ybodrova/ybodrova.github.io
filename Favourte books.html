	            <li>Me Before You by Jojo Moyes</li>
				This was one of the best books I have ever read.Before you start this book...<br>
				be prepared to cry. You will cry happy tears and sad tears. You will smile,<br>
				laugh, be devastated, ugly cry, and if your like me- you will love the journey<br>
				this book took you on. This is a story of two people who meet each other by chance,<br>
				and change each others lives forever.
