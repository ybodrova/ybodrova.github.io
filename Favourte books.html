	            <li>The Help by Kathryn Stockett</li>
				<p>This first novel by Kathryn Stockett is amazing. This is one of those few books <br>
				that grabbed my emotions and interest so deeply that I could not stop thinking about <br>
				the book when I would set it down to attend to other activities (like eating, sleeping & <br>
				working!). I was engrossed and couldn't wait to read more, while at the same time savoring <br>
				every chapter as the story developed. </p>
